			Salt Minion 0.17.5-2 64-bit on Windows</h1>
		<div>
This software asset installs the Salt Minion 64-bit on Windows by downloading from SaltStack.com, or by copying from the media folder if the installer is provided there.  To use this asset to install another version, simply change the %INSTALLER% variable in the install-salt-minion.bat script.  For CONS3RT deployments, this install script looks for either a Scenario role name or a Deployment runtime propety with the name "salt-master".  If salt-master is found, the script automatically installs Salt Minion to point to the salt-master.  Otherwise, it downloads or copies the Salt Minion installer to C:\cons3rt for manual installation after logging in.  Note: Automatic installation may fail if you define BOTH a Scenario Role Name and a Deployment Runtime Property.</div>
